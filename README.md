# Sandbox

**This is just a small learning experiment for me and the simulation will almost definitely have issues if you try to expand it.** 

Simple and messy implementation of simulating sand and water with cellular automata. There are *some* comments amogst the code if you're looking for help on your own simulation.


# Controls
**W A S D** for movement
**Left Shift** to place rock
**Left Control** to place water
**Space** to place sand

# Dependencies
**SDL2-2.24.1** was used for creating the program window, reading inputs and rendering on the window.
